# 2024-YHM-Weather
I have set up a bunch of Python scrips for both visualizations and to take the info from a database to show monthly highs, lows, precipitation among plenty of other metrics.
I will post examples below. 

This script is ready to run entirely for Canadian cities if you use the same website to download from the database, so minimal changes will be needed for the same outputs.
